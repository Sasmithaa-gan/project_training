        <h1> Leading in an evolving tax and business landscape</h1>

        <p>
            The world around us has changed dramatically in recent years, with geopolitical shifts and technological innovation; globalization, on the one hand, and protectionism, on the other; various tax reforms and regulatory change; new business and consumer demands and the emergence of previously unseen types of business models. These shifts and the resulting complexities and pressures are felt even more acutely in  the wake of COVID-19.
            <br /><br />As a tax leader operating in this new reality, you are expected to be not only a technical specialist, but also a brand ambassador and trusted advisor to your business and board as you work to protect the organization, boost performance, drive digital transformation and contribute to the sustainability goals of the organization.
